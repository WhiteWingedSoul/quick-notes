# CHAPTER 3: Core Java APIs
_0430-0506_

# Exam objectives
1. Using Operators and Desicion Constructs
  - Test equality between Strings and objects using == and equals().
2. Creating and Using Arrays
  - Declare, instantiate, initialize and use a one-dimensional array.
  - Declare, instantiate, initialize and use a multi-dimensional array.
3. Working with Selected classes from the Java API
  - Creating and manipulating Strings.
  - Manipulate data using the StringBuilder class and its methods.
  - Declare and use an ArrayList of a given type.
  - Create and manipulate calendar data using classes from java.time.LocalDateTime, java.time.LocalDate, java.time.Local-Time, java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter, java.time.Period.
4. Working with Java Data Types
  - Develop code that uses wrapper classes such as Boolean, Double, and Integer.

# Notes
## Creating and Manipulating Strings
- A string is basically a sequence of characters.
- String class is a special class, doesn't need to be instantiated with new.
  - `String name = "Fluffy";`
  - `String name = new String("Fluffy");`

### Concatenation 
- Placing String before the other String and combining them together is called string concatenating. The + operator can be used in two ways within the same line of code:
1. If both operands are numeric, + means numeric addition.
2. If either operand is a String, + means concatenation.
3. The expression is evaluated left to right.

ie.
```java
  System.out.println(1 + 2); // 2
  System.out.println("a" + "b"); // ab
  System.out.println("a" + "b" + 3); // ab3
  System.out.println(1 + 2 + "c"); // 3c
```

### Immutability
- **String objects are immutable**, once they are created, they can not be made larger or smaller, and you cannot change one of the characters inside them.

### The String Pool
- Strings are everywhere in Java, they use up a lot of memory, Java solves this issue by reusing common ones. The `string pool`, also known as the intern pool, is a location in the JVM that collects all these strings.
- The string pool contains literal values that appear in your program. Strings not in the string pool are garbage collected just like any other object.

```java
String name = "Fluffy"; // this is a literal string.
String name = new String("Fluffy"); // this is not a literal string.
```
- The second way is less efficient than the first way, however, it is allowed.

### Important String Methods
- A string is a sequence of characters and zero-indexed.

#### length()

```java
String string = "animals";
System.out.println(string.length()); // 7
```
- Returns the number of characters in the String.

#### charAt()

```java
String string = "animals";
System.out.println(string.charAt(0)); // a
System.out.println(string.charAt(6)); // s
System.out.println(string.charAt(7)); // throws exception
```

- Lets you query the string to find out what charater is at a specific index.
- **Indexes start counting with 0**.

#### indexOf()
